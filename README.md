Task: Create APIs for User and Occupation Models
Overview
You are required to create a simple Node.js application using Express and Mongoose that allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for User and Occupation models. The User model will store basic user information, while the Occupation model will store the occupation details related to the user.


User Model:
1) Name
2) Surname
3) Age
4) Mobile Number
5) Email

Note -  Need to verify mobile number and email is valid or not.

Occupation Model:  
1) User occupation
2) Yearly income

Note -  Based on this both models need to create all possible apis and need to do proper error handling with proper status code.
